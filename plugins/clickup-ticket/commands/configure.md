description: Set up the ClickUp ticket skill - configure defaults and cache workspace data.
---

Use your `clickup-ticket` Skill in **configure** mode.

This command:
1. Validates your `CLICKUP_TICKET_SKILL_TOKEN`
2. Fetches available workspaces
3. Caches spaces, lists, tags, and members
4. Sets your default list, assignee, and preferences

Use `--reset` to clear all cached data and start fresh.

See the SKILL.md for full workflow details.
