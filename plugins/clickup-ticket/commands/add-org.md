Use your `clickup-ticket` Skill in **add-org** mode.

Adds a new workspace to your configuration:
1. Selects which token to use
2. Discovers available workspaces
3. Caches the workspace data
4. Sets org-specific defaults

**Flags:**
- `--token-env=<VAR>` - Use a different environment variable for this org
- `--switch` - Switch to the new org after adding

See the SKILL.md for full details.
