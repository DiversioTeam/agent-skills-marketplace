description: Create a ClickUp ticket interactively with full control over all fields.
---

Use your `clickup-ticket` Skill in **create-ticket** mode.

Walks through creating a ticket with:
- Title, list, priority, assignee(s), tags, description, due date

Uses cached workspace data for fast selection. Prompts with numbered choices
from your actual ClickUp lists, members, and tags.

**Flags:**
- `--org=<slug>` - Create in a different organization
- `--list=<name>` - Pre-select list
- `--priority=<1-4>` - Pre-set priority
- `--tag=<tags>` - Pre-set tags (comma-separated)

See the SKILL.md for detailed workflow.
