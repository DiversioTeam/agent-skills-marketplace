Use your `clickup-ticket` Skill in **switch-org** mode.

Changes the active organization for all subsequent commands.

**Usage:**
```
/clickup-ticket:switch-org           # Interactive selection
/clickup-ticket:switch-org personal  # Direct switch by name/slug
```

Each org maintains its own defaults and cached data.
